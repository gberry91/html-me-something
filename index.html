              first game in the franchise was released on the
              Nintendo Famicom in 1986, the series has been a

                <p>The release of the Famicom by Nintendo in 1983 saw
                the video game industry take hold of living rooms across
                Japan. After gaining critical and commercial success, Nintendo
                released an updated version of the console in North America
                two years later. Nintendo became an icon with their new mascot
                Super Mario, created by Shigeru Miyamoto. Seeing Mario as one
                dimensional and not capable of proving a completely unrestricted
                experience, Miyamoto went back to the drawing board and started
                work on his next game: <em>The Legend of Zelda.</em></p>

                <p>The Legend of Zelda</em> was released in Japan on February 21, 1986.
                Selling over 6.5 million copies, The game was met with critical acclaim.
                Fans of the series were treated to a sequel with 1987's <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em>.
                Though it too gained critical and financial success, it as seen as the
                black sheep in the series by fans due to it's level of difficulty and
                side-scrolling battle mechanics. </p>

                <p>With the release of a new console, the Super Famicom, Miyamoto and the staff at Nintendo began
                  working on the second sequel to their 1986 hit. Released one year after the console hit stores,<em> The
                  Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em> was an instant classic. It focused more on storytelling and
                  delivering a cohesive narrative rather than open world freedom. This would later become a point of
                  contention among fans of the series as each subsequent game would progessively become more linear.

                <p>Due to the overwhelming success of <em>A Link to the Past</em>, the Zelda team began working on a port of
                the game to it's handheld game console, the Nintendo Gameboy. After several months of working on the game
                the project turned into an original story written by Yoshiaki Koizumi. The new mobile Zelda was released
                under the name <em>Link's Awakening</em> in June of 1993. The game was later remade in color for the Gameboy Color
                in 1998. Both copies like their home console veriosns sold exceptionally well and are still considered
                some of Nintendo's best games. Dude to the success of both versions of<em> Link's Awakening</em>, Nintendo
                would continue to develop 2D Zelda games on it's handheld consoles as home consoles transitioned into
                the world of 3D rendered graphics.</p>

                <p>As the the home video game industry saw a boom in popularity and availability in the late 80s and
                early 90s, game devlopers were constantly competing with each other and rushing to come out with
                the next big thing. Nintendo was looking to their next console: the Nintendo 64. As the N64 was capable
                of rendering graphics in 3D, Miyomoto and his team began working on the first 3D Zelda. Using a similar
                narrative structure to <em>A Link to the Past</em>, the new Zelda game dubbed <em>Ocarina of Time</em>
                presented the Zelda's world with depth for the first time. As the camera perspective was changed from
                an overhead view to a behind the shoulder angle, developers ran into issues translating the action
                oriented sections of the game into 3D in a way that was comfortable and intuitive to the player.
                To make the combat work in a 3D environment the team introduced "Z-Targeting" as a way to track
                enemies around the 3D environment. This became a staple of the franchise, having been in every
                3D Zelda game since. <em>Ocarina of Time</em> received universal praise from critics and gamers over
                the world selling over 7.6 million copies world-wide and is considered the one of the highest rated games
                of all time.</p>

                <p><em>Ocarina of Time</em> received a sequel in 2000 with the release of <em>Majora's Mask'</em>. Using
                the assets from it's predecessor, <em>Majora's Mask</em> was developed in just a year. Though it was
                not quite as successful as other titles in the series <em>Majora</em> is now considered a cult classic
                and has gained support from many as an essential game in the series and one of the best video game sequels
                ever created.</p>

                <p>Following the transition to 3D, Nintendo released three more games in the series with <em>The Windwaker</em>,
                <em>Twilight Princess</em>, and <em>Skyward Sword</em> respectively. Though each game introduced a new
                gameplay mechanic with the implementation of key items and new methods of control input, the formula created
                in <em>A Link to the Past</em> and revolutionized in <em>Ocarina of Time</em> largely remained unchanged
                since the transition to 3D. As with previous games in the series, the later entries in the <em>Zelda</em>
                franchise received critical and commercial acclaim due to their innovation of the adventure genre and their
                impressive visual storytelling.</p>

                <p>With the latest game in the franchise <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, Miyamoto and
                  the development team shifted their focus back to open word exploring with a lighter emphasis on
                  direct storytelling. Becoming one of the highest selling and rated games of all time upon release,
                  <em>Breath of the Wild</em> has continued the practice of introducing new game mechanics and innovation
                  through cutting edge hardware and technology. Many gamers and fans eagerly wait to see what new ideas
                  Nintendo will come up with in future installments.</p>
